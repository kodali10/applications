# Dice Game

### How to play?
* The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
* In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
* BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
* The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
* The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
